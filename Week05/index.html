        <h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>
        <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:<br>
            •	System error ― there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting <br>
            •	Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.<br>
            •	User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.<br>
            It's kind of weird how underestimated testing and debugging is, sometimes we think it's just about creating new things but the tools to fix bugs are just as important.

        <h4>Debugger:</h4>
        <p>The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.
            This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.
            If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.
            With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line.

        <h4>Testing Frameworks:</h4>
        <p><b>Jest:</b> <br> 
            Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions. <br>
            <h4>Question</h4>
            <b class="question"> So far I have seen that Jest is very popular when testing JavaScript code, my question is it also equally useful in testing frameworks like React, Angular or backend frameworks like NextJS? or is there a better option for testing frameworks?</b>
