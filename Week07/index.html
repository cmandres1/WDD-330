        <h4>Callbacks:</h4>
        <p>Many functions are provided by JavaScript host environments that allow you to schedule asynchronous actions.
            In other words, actions that we initiate now, but they finish later.
            For instance, one such function is the setTimeout function.
            The ability of a JavaScript function to accept another function as an argument is a powerful aspect of the
            language.
            A caller of the function can pass another function as an argument to execute based on any trigger.

        <h4>Promise:</h4>
        <p>Promises in JavaScript are very similar to promises in real life, you make a promise to do something and you
            will either complete or fail to achieve that promise.
            There are three possible results for promises:
            <ul>Pending: When the promise is still pending (initial state).</ul>
            <ul>Fulfilled: When the promise is achieved and gets resolved(success).</ul>
            <ul>Rejected: When the promise is failed(rejected).</ul>
            We usually use these promises for asynchronous operations (when you have more than one task that needs to be
            run at the same time). So, we use them to supply the result or the task at some point in the future.

        <h4>Asynchronous:</h4>
        <p>
            Async is a short form for “asynchronous”. Synchronous means executing statements one after the other which
            implies the next statement will get executed only after the previous statement is executed completely.
            Whereas in Asynchronous calls the next statement gets executed without even waiting for the previous one’s
            execution.

        <div class="js_fetch">
            <h4>Fetch():</h4>
            <p>
                Fetch() function is a global method by JavaScript which allows us to retrieve resources asynchronously
                across the network.
