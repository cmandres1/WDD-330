    <div class="js_objects">
        <h4>Object Methods – this :</h4>
        <p>To access the object, a method can use the “this” keyword.
            The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.
            From what I understand JavaScript is not an object-oriented language, but it has a lot of support for it I
            think which is perhaps what makes it so functional and so widely used. I remember reading that, almost
            everything in JavaScript is an object. In fact, only six things are not objects. They are - null, undefined,
            strings, numbers, boolean, and symbols.
        </p>
        <h4>Computed Properties:</h4>
        <p>The ability to create objects with computed property keys was introduced in ES6. This means that JavaScript
            code can be placed inside square brackets and the property key will be the return value of that code. This
            can be seen in the example below where the + operator is used to concatenate the strings 'catch' and
            'phrase':

            const hulk = { name: 'Hulk', ['catch' + 'Phrase']: 'Hulk Smash!' };

            Objects have many utilities and can even be constantly updated or changed, such as adding properties or
            changing properties, or even creating objects that have other objects.
            You can copy or clone objects, but those cloned objects will point to the same space in memory.
        </p>
        <h4>JSON</h4>
        <p>JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, was invented by Douglas Crockford in 2001. It is an extremely popular
            lightweight data-storage format that is used by a large number of services for data serialization and
            configuration. It is often used to exchange information between web services, and is employed by sites such
            as Twitter, Facebook and Trello to share information. The beauty of JSON is that it manages to hit the sweet
            spot between being both human- and machine-readable.
            The objects that are already inside JavaScript make everything easier, for me the idea of programming is to
            make everything easier, and even that can be applied within programming languages, it is not necessary to be
            creating over and over again something that has already been done before, all these objects built into JS
            are very useful and makes everything easier.
        </p>
        <h4>Question:</h4>
        <p>The validations with RegExp and how they are written inside JS has been something very complicated for me to
            understand, but my doubt is, <b class="question"> they are very used or it is the simplest way? there is
                something similar?</b>
            probably it is only a matter of dedicating more time specifically to investigate them and to be able to see
            the true utility of RegExp.
        </p>

    <div class="js_dom">
        <h4>DOM:</h4>
        <p>Of all the ways to get an element I think the one I've seen used the most or perhaps the most useful for me
            is "document.querySelector".
            Having access to the DOM is something really useful to be able to "show" what we are coding in a more
            friendly or simple way to the eye.
            There are many useful properties to modify it and even add visual components with CSS.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="js_events">
        <h4>Events:</h4>
        <p>Whenever an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function is called. This function is
            automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains information about the event.</p>
        <h4>Question:</h4>
        <p>There is a very large number of event types, although they should all be equally useful, I think it will be
            complicated to know or even use them all,<b class="question"> what are the most common or most used event types?</b>
