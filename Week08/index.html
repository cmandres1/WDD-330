    <div class="js_transform">
        <h4>Transform:</h4>
        <p>With the CSS transform property you can rotate, move, skew, and scale elements.<br>
            <b>Translate:</b><br>
            The translate value moves an element left/right and up/down. The movement is based on the parameters given
            for the X (horizontal) Y (vertical) axes.<br>
            A positive X value moves the element to the right, while a negative X moves the element to the left. A
            positive Y value moves the element downwards and a negative Y value, upwards.<br>
            <b>Scale:</b><br>
            The scale value allows you to increase or decrease the size of an element.<br>
            <b>Rotate:</b><br>
            With the rotate value, the element rotates clockwise or counterclockwise by a specified number of degrees. A
            positive value, such as 90deg, rotates the element clockwise, while a negative value, such as -90deg,
            rotates it counterclockwise.<br>
            <b>Skew:</b><br>
            With the skew value, the element skews (or tilts) one direction or the other based on the values given for
            the X and Y axes. <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="js_transition:">
        <h4>Transition:</h4>
        <p>Transitions are the grease in the wheel of CSS transforms. Without a transition, an element being transformed
            would change abruptly from one state to another. By applying a transition, you can control the change,
            making it smooth and gradual. <br>

            <b>Note:</b> Transition Shorthand
            Each transition property can be defined individually, but for cleaner and faster code, it’s recommended that
            you use the transition shorthand.<br>

            Here’s the full shorthand sequence. Again, the first two properties are required. <br>
            div { <br>
            transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay]; <br>
            } <br>
            <b>Transition-property (required):</b> <br>
            The transition-property specifies the CSS property where the transition will be applied. You may apply a
            transition to an individual property (e.g., background-color or transform) or to all properties in the
            rule-set (i.e., all). <br>
            <b>Transition-duration (required):</b> <br>
            The transition-duration property specifies the time span of the transition. You can specify in seconds or
            milliseconds. <br>

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="js_animations:">
        <h4>Animations::</h4>
        <p>
            You create a CSS Animation by defining an animation in @keyframes. <br>
            You can add any number of points on the @keyframes declaration. Each point you add should be a percentage
            value. (You can also substitute from for 0% and to for 100%).

            <h4>Question:</h4>
            Drag and drop is something completely new to me, although I have seen it work in many applications, I didn't
            know how they were created. I looked for more information about it, but I could only find examples of where
            it is used,
            <b class="question"> <b>could you recommend any page where I can find more detailed information about this
                    functionality?</b>
        </p>
