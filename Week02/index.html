        <h4 first> Reserved Words â€“ Infinity:</h4>
        <p>New to me, until today I did not know that there was an "Infinity" in JavaScript, I had never thought about a
            number whose value was so large that it could not be calculated by a programming language.</p>
        <h4>Methods:</h4>
        <p>There are many methods for working with numbers and strings that I didn't know about and they are all quite
            useful. I usually prefer to watch video tutorials instead of reading, but there is a lot of information that
            can't be shared in a 10-15 minutes video, let alone explained as they do in books or internet as the case of
            all those methods.</p>
        <h4>Question:</h4>
        <p>The "spread" operator is also something I didn't know, I think it is very useful to work with Arrays and to
            be able to join all their values in a single Array.
            Although there are many similarities between Arrays, Sets and Map, I also see that there is something that
            makes them unique for when we need to use them
            <b class="question"> which one is more common or more used of the 3? and why?</b>
        </p>
        <h4>Logic:</h4>
        <p>Ternary operator, I know that you are constantly looking for improvements to prevent the code from being too
            long and that you don't have more lines of code than necessary, I think it is a great help, both in having
            less lines of code as well as the time needed to code it.</p>
        <h4>Functions:</h4>
        <p>Last week when I saw some examples, I wondered what is "hoisting" and in the Functions section it explains it
            very clearly, I thought it would be something complicated, but I see it as a way to try to avoid that there
            is an error. The use of "const" and "let" is a recommendation as a good practice. Maybe the issue is more
            complicated than I can understand now, but for the time being I think trying to avoid it will be the best
            thing to do.
            For me the most important part of the section are "callbacks", calling parts of code that is already written
            to avoid writing or repeating it is in my opinion something very useful. I haven't known JavaScript for a
            long time, but from what I see in books and tutorials, it has been updated to improve runtime based and add
            more options to make it easier for the programmer to get what he needs.
