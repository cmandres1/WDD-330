        <h2 first-read> Doing Stuff with Web Things</h2>
        <p>I have always thought that things that are very straightforward and easy for me to understand turn out to be
            not so easy for the user to understand, but I remember in a design course I learned that we should not do
            anything thinking about what we know as we are not the user. We have to be very specific when it comes to
            users.</p>
        <h4>Naming conventions:</h4>
        <p>An important thing to always remember is to name variables or functions as clearly as possible even if only
            you have access to the code, it helps us and will help us to make sense of what we are doing if after a long
            time we have to go back to modify code that we did some time ago.</p>
        <h4>Question:</h4>
        <p>Many people have told me that the use of the word "var" is not highly recommended because it causes something
            called "hoisting" and can give some unexpected results.
            But I have a doubt, <b class="question"> what is "hoisting" and why does it worry programmers in a certain
                way?
                and why do most tutorials, videos or books still use "var" in their examples?</b>

        <h2>Mobile First</h2>
            <p> Since I started learning everything related to Frontend development, I have heard many times that we
                should
                start everything thinking about mobile devices. It's been less than a year since I started my first job
                as a
                Frontend developer and I know that I still have many things to learn and some things that for me seem
                very
                difficult, but the people I work with have never done so and when I ask them, they tell me that, even if
                they
                know it, they don't do it because it doesn't help them as much as they say when they start teaching you
                the
                mobile first method. I understand that it depends a lot on the situation and that it will not always be
                used,
                but <b class="question">why do there seem to be few people who do mobile first even if there is too much diffusion for
                    everyone
                    to
                    adopt it as a common practice?</b>
            </p>
            <p>Something I had not thought of before and that the videos make quite clear is that you can constantly add
                improvements depending on the behavior that users have with the page or application, to say that it is
                designed for users to have a great experience involves providing support and continually update to
                maintain users and increase them.</p>
