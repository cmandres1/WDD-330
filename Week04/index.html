        <h4>Forms:</h4>
        <p>Now I see that the "forms" have many more utilities than I thought, normally the first thing that came to my
            mind were login forms.
            In JavaScript, the focus and blur events are opposite to each other. The focus event occurs when you click
            on an input field and the field gets focused.
            The blur event occurs when you click away from an input field and the field loses focus.
            You can use the focus event if you need to run some logic whenever someone clicks on the input field.
            You will use the blur event if you need to run some logic when the user leaves the input field by clicking
            away.

        <h4>OOP JS:</h4>
        <p>Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance is not something that is commonly mentioned in JavaScript but we
            constantly even without realizing it use it.
            Prototypical inheritance refers to the ability to access object properties from another object. We use a
            JavaScript prototype to add new properties and methods to an existing object constructor. We can then
            essentially tell our JS code to inherit properties from a prototype. Prototypical inheritance allows us to
            reuse the properties or methods from one JavaScript object to another through a reference pointer function.

        <h4>Modern JavaScript Development:</h4>
        <p>These days, libraries are very much mentioned and also very much used, if we want to dedicate ourselves
            completely to front-end development at some point we will most likely use some library.
            One of the best advantages of the libraries is to reduce the amount of code we have to write, making things
            easier for us by adding templates that compile directly with HTML.
